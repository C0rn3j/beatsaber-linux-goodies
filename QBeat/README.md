# QBeat
A Cross platform mod installer for Beat Saber

Current state is very early proof of concept
- Very limited functionality
- Only tested on Linux (/should/ work on windows, but I bet it's buggy)
- Just a command line interface at first, gui will come once actions are implemented

If you want to try this feel free, let me know how it goes.

Like all early software this might break your beatsaber installation, delete your files, and make the kittens cry. If you don't know what you're doing ask first, or wait until things are ready :)
