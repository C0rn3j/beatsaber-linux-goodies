# Beat Saber Linux Goodies

# Install Method 1: QBeat
QBeat is currently under development still but is functional enough to get things working. 
If you'd prefer a GUI for installing mods then see method 2 instead.

QBeat can be used to setup wine/proton, download mods, and patch beat saber in a relatively easy manner.
The scripts from method 2 are included with QBeat and will continue to be maintained for use with other mod installers.

# Install Method 2: Beatdrop + script hacks
Beatdrop can also be used for mod installation, it's not something I'll be actively working on but should remain functional.

# What
Mod installation scripts and other goodies for running Beat Saber on Linux.

This repository is mainly for gathering information, and implementations of tools to make setup easier.

The eventual target is to provide Linux native tools, allowing 1-click installs for Beat Saber mods.

# Why
Beat Saber itself has run perfectly on Linux for quite some time, but the modding tools mainly target Windows. Some run fine under wine but even then there's a few hacks needed to get mods to load/etc.

# Bugs/Support
If you're having issues on Linux it's probably best if you don't pester the BeatDrop/ModAssistant/Mod devs directly for now.
Raising a ticket here is probably a better plan, and will keep the Linux-specific hacks in one place.
