Thanks to the fact it's written in electron porting BeatDrop to Linux was trivial. 

Current Status: Early Alpha/Proof of concept

This is functionally close to complete but I don't think I'll be finishing the port. If you're good with electron/node.js and want to help it shouldn't be too difficult. Going forward I plan to maintain QBeat instead, fresh start and a more familiar language.

[My BeatDrop Fork](https://github.com/geefr/BeatDrop/releases). This is a Linux port of BeatDrop with a few tweaks here and there.

In addition to the mod downloads you'll need to patch the game correctly, see the [scripts directory](scripts/README.md) for instructions/further detail.
